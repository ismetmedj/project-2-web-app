The idea was to make a collaborative web application using a MongoDB database and newly acquired CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) techniques and deploy it on Render.<br>
The project uses AJAX, CRUD, DOM Manipulation, and so on.


Here is an upload of the web-app (it takes a little while to load, because of Render) :
